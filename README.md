How to contribute to a project:
Proposing Changes to someones project
-Fork the repo (A Fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.)
-make a fix
-submit a pull request

How to do that:
-click fork on the top of the page
-create a local clone of your fork
-copy the clone url for the fork
-in the terminal: create a folder, cd into it and type git clone (paste the url that you copied earlier)
-git remote -v (shows the current remote master)
-once you have made the changes on your local, commit them to your forked repository.
-do a git pull on the master repository on git hub to merge your changes to the master
